        <h1>Website redesign</h1>
        <p>This design took me 4 hours, but its significantly better than my previous one. The new design scales better on mobile devices, has an index for article posts, and in my opinion, looks cleaner. I will soon make the page interactive, as thats what I'm learning next. Thanks to The Odin Project for being a great teacher.</p>
